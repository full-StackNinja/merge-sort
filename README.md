# Merge Sort Algorithm

- In order to run the mergeSort.js file to see the output, type "node mergeSort.js" in the terminal and press enter.
- Also if you want to automatically run the file when something is changed in the code file, then just install "nodemon" globally by entering "npm install -g nodemon" command in the terminal. After installing, run nodemon <filename.js> in the terminal.
